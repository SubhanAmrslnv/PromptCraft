Initialize the global Claude Code configuration for this machine.

Perform the following steps in order:

## 1. Verify hooks directory
Check that `~/.claude/hooks/` exists. If not, create it.

## 2. Verify hook scripts
Check that all required hook scripts exist in `~/.claude/hooks/`:
- `pre-guard.sh`
- `post-format.sh`
- `post-audit-log.sh`
- `stop-build-and-fix.sh`
- `stop-git-autocommit.sh`
- `stop-notify.sh`

If any are missing, read the corresponding file from the current repo's `.claude/hooks/` directory and write it to `~/.claude/hooks/`.

## 3. Verify settings.json
Check that `~/.claude/settings.json` exists and contains the `hooks` key wiring all the scripts above. If missing or incomplete, copy from this repo's `.claude/settings.json`.

## 4. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Check if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in the environment. If not, remind the user to add it to their shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) — it is required for AI-generated commit messages and auto build-fix.

## 5. Report
Print a summary table of what was already present, what was created, and what still needs manual action.
